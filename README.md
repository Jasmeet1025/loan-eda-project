# 📊 Loan Data EDA Project

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a loan dataset, aiming to understand the structure, quality, and key patterns in the data. It was done entirely using **Python** in **Jupyter Notebook**, using popular data analysis libraries.

---

## 📁 Dataset Description

- **Dataset Name**: Loan Data  
- **Source**: Local file (`loan_data.csv`)  
- **Size**: Contains multiple records with borrower and loan details  
- **Features**: Includes numeric, categorical, and possibly text-based columns related to loan applications, such as loan amount, interest rate, purpose, etc.

---

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used

- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for creating visualizations  
- **Warnings module** – to suppress unnecessary warnings

## 🔍 EDA Process Overview

1. **Data Loading**
2. **Initial Inspection**
   - Shape, column types, and basic statistics
3. **Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values and irrelevant columns
   - Removed duplicates
   - Typecasting and formatting
4. **Outlier Detection and Handling**
5. **Encoding Categorical Variables**
6. **Correlation Analysis**
   - Identified key relationships between variables
7. **Visual Analysis**
   - Scatterplot, boxplots and heatmaps

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features requiring careful preprocessing.
- Correlation analysis helped identify potential multicollinearity or key predictors.
- Visualizations revealed patterns in loan amount distribution, ownership types, and purpose of loans.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jasmeet1025/loan-eda-project.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter notebook:
